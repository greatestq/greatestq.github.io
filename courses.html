            <h2>Courses/Projects at The Cooper Union</h2>

Below is a list of Engineering and Mathematics/Physics courses I took at the Cooper Union. I am predominantly interested in applying rigorous mathematical tools to analyze/solve complex mechanical engineering problems. I am also interested in learning data-driven approaches to solving mechanical engineering problems. I am currently studying machine learning on my own.

            <h2>Projects</h2>

                    <p>Below, you can find links to some of the projects I worked on either for courses or just for fun! I do a lot of CS/Machine Learning projects outside of school with Hailey Chung. You can also check out her works in this <a href="https://hayooniverse.github.io">link</a></p>

            <h2>Programming Languages / Software Tools</h2>
<ul>
I utilize Python, MATLAB, and Latex most of the time for my course/research works. Depending on what project I am working on, I ocassionally use Onshape, Ansys, Arduino, and ROS.
